# Decentralized Identity Platform

A modern web application for managing decentralized digital identities, built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This platform demonstrates the implementation of self-sovereign identity principles, allowing users to create and manage their digital identities in a decentralized manner.

## Features

- Decentralized Identity Creation: Generate unique DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) for users
- Identity Management: Create and manage digital identity profiles
- Public Key Infrastructure: Secure key pair generation for identity verification
- Credential Management: View and manage verifiable credentials
- Modern UI: Responsive and intuitive user interface built with Tailwind CSS
- Type Safety: Built with TypeScript for enhanced development experience

## Technology Stack

- Frontend Framework: React 18
- Language: TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Build Tool: Vite
- Icons: Lucide React
- Development Tools: ESLint, PostCSS, Autoprefixer

```

## Architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Components**: Reusable UI components with specific responsibilities
- **Types**: TypeScript interfaces for type safety and documentation
- **Utils**: Helper functions for DID and key pair generation

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with Cardano Atala PRISM for production-ready DID operations
- Secure key management and storage
- Verifiable credential issuance and verification
- Integration with blockchain networks
- Enhanced privacy features
- Mobile application support
